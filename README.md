# London Studios - Update
Since forming London Studios in April 2020 we've created a number of **high quality** and **premium** resources for the FiveM project, focusing on the emergency services and aiming to bring your server to the next level.

Although we made a number of free resources such as this one in the first year, we've now switched to creating paid content, keeping them constantly updated and working along with providing the best possible support to our customers.

Our **most popular** resources now include *Smart Fires, Police Grappler* and *Smart Hose*.

With **thousands** of **happy customers** we are confident you'll love our resources and our active support team are on hand to help if you have any questions!

# Our store: https://store.londonstudios.net/github
# Our discord: https://discord.gg/nC2krpN

Therefore, this resource is now likely *out of date* and is *no longer supported by us*. The full source code is available should you wish to make any changes. All of our paid resources however are constantly updated and we invite you to take a look!

# Vehicle Objects - London Studios
**Vehicle Objects** is a **FiveM** resource coded in **C#** allowing you to add objects such as learner plates, pass plates and parking tickets/penalty charges to vehicles. This will be updated in the future with more objects, such as taxi signs and more!

The included models have been created by myself.

This plugin is made by **LondonStudios**, we have created a variety of releases including TaserFramework, SearchHandler, ActivateAlarm, SmartTester, SmartSounds, CustodyAlarm, SmartObservations and more!

## Usage
**/lplate** - Add learner plates to the nearest vehicle, or the one you are in.
**/pplate** - Add pass plates to the nearest vehicle, or the one you are in.
**/penaltycharge** - Add a parking ticket/penalty charge to the nearest vehicle, or the one you are in.

Simply run the command again to remove the relevant objects. This should work on most vehicles, however for the plates, only one may appear on some vehicles. There should be one at the front and back.
## Installation
 1.  Create a new **resource folder** on your server.
 2.  Add the contents of **"resource"** inside it. This includes:
"Client.net.dll", "fxmanifest.lua", "stream"
3. In **server.cfg**, "ensure" Vehicle Objects, to make it load with your server startup.
## Source Code
Please find the source code in the **"src"** folder. Please ensure you follow the licence in **"LICENCE.md"**.

## Feedback
We appreciate feedback, bugs and suggestions related to Vehicle Objects and future plugins. We hope you enjoy using the resource and look forward to hearing from people!
